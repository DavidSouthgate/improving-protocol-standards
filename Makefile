# Configuration for make itself:

# Warn if the Makefile references undefined variables and remove built-in rules:
MAKEFLAGS += --warn-undefined-variables --no-builtin-rules --no-builtin-variables

# Remove output of failed commands, to avoid confusing later runs of make:
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:

# Remove obsolete old-style default suffix rules:
.SUFFIXES:

# List of targets that don't represent files:
.PHONY: all clean

# The PDF files to build, each should have a corresponding .tex file:
PDF_FILES = notes/improving-protocol-standards.pdf \
            notes/quic-example.pdf \
            notes/ir.pdf \
            papers/improving-quic-docs.pdf

# Tools to build before the PDF files. This is a list of executable files in
# the bin/ directory:
TOOLS = 

# Master build rule:
all: $(TOOLS) $(PDF_FILES)

# Pattern rules to build a PDF file. The assumption is that each PDF file 
# is built from the corresponding .tex file.

# Pattern rules to build plots using gnuplot. These require the data
# to be plotted be in figures/%.dat, while the script to control the
# plot is in figures/%.gnuplot. The script figures/%.gnuplot-pdf (or
# figures/%.gnuplot-svg) is loaded before the main gnuplot script,
# and should call "set terminal ..." and "set output ..." to set the
# appropriate format and output file. This allows the main gnuplot 
# script to be terminal independent.
