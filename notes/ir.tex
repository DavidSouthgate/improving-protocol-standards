\begin{abstract}

% Four sentences:

%  - Say what your solution achieves
%  - Say what follows from your solution

\section{Introduction}

% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?



% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.



% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs 
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.



% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.



% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

\section{Intermediate Representation}

The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'', ``NOT RECOMMENDED'',
``MAY'', and ``OPTIONAL'' in this document are to be interpreted as
described in \cite{RFC2119,RFC8174} when, and only when, they appear
in all capitals, as shown here.



The intermediate representation is specified in terms of serialised JSON
\cite{RFC7159} objects that describe the packet formats to be specified.
An interpreter for the intermediate representation will read a sequence of
such objects and perform the operations described, in the order that they
objects are read.

Each JSON object in the intermediate representation MUST contain a member
with name \texttt{irobject} that describes the contents of the object.
Whether other members are included in the object depends on the value of
the \texttt{irobject} member.

Initially, only a single primitive type is defined, the \texttt{Bit}. A Bit
may have value 0 or 1, or have an unspecified value. As the intermediate
representation is loaded, it defines other types. Types MUST NOT be used
before they have been defined.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Arrays}

If an intermediate representation JSON object contains an \texttt{irobject}
member with the value \texttt{array}, then that object defines a new array
type. For example, a type \texttt{SeqNum}, being an array of 16 elements of
type Bit, could be defined as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    'irobject'    : 'array',
    'name'        : 'SeqNum',
    'elementType' : 'Bit'
    'length'      : 16
  }
\end{verbatim}

In addition to the \texttt{irobject} member, the object MUST also include
the following members:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{name} indicates the name of the type being defined. It is
    an error to define a name multiple times.
  \item \texttt{elementType} indicates the type of the elements of the
    array.
  \item \texttt{length} indicates the number of elements in the array. This
    MAY be set to \texttt{null} to indicate an array of unspecified length.
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Enumerated Types}

If an intermediate representation JSON object contains an \texttt{irobject}
member with the value \texttt{enum}, then that object defines a new enumerated
type. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    'irobject'    : 'enum'
    'name'        : '<string>',
    'variants'    : [
      {'type' : '<typename>'},
      ...
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}

An enumerated type represents data that can be one of several possible
variants. In addition to the \texttt{irobject} member, the object MUST
also include the following members:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{name} indicates the name of the type being defined. It is
    an error to define a name multiple times.
  \item \texttt{variants} is a JSON array, each value of which is an object
    containing a member named \texttt{type} that has a value indicating one
    possible type that they enumerated type can take. The type MUST have
    been previously defined.  The variants array MUST NOT be empty. Each
    variant has a type, but is otherwise unnamed.
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Structure Types}

If an intermediate representation JSON object contains an \texttt{irobject}
member with the value \texttt{struct}, then that object defines a new
structure type. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    'irobject'    : 'struct'
    'name'        : '<string>',
    'fields'      : [
                      {
                        'name' : '...',
                        'type' : ...
                      },
                      ...
                    ],
    'constraints' : [
                      ...
                    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}

A structure type represents data comprising an ordered sequence of elements
of possibly different types. In addition to the \texttt{irobject} member, 
the object MUST also include the following members:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{name} indicates the name of the type being defined. It is
    an error to define a name multiple times.
  \item \texttt{fields} is a JSON array, each value of which is an object
    containing two members, \texttt{name} and \texttt{type}, that indicate
    the fields's name and type. The type MUST have been previously defined.
    The fields array MUST NOT be empty; the names of each element within
    the fields array MUST be unique, but multiple elements can have the
    same type.
  \item \texttt{constraints} ...
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Function Prototypes}

If an intermediate representation JSON object contains an \texttt{irobject}
member with the value \texttt{function}, then that object defines a function
prototype. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    'irobject'    : 'function'
    'name'        : 'decrypt',
    'parameters'  : [
      {
        'name' : 'enc_payload',
        'type' : 'cryptobits'
      },
      {
        'name' : 'pn',
        'type' : 'full_packet_num'
      }
    ],
    'returnType'  : 'bit',
  }
\end{verbatim}
