\section{Introduction}

% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?



% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.



% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs 
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.



% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.



% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

\section{Terminology}

The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'', ``NOT RECOMMENDED'',
``MAY'', and ``OPTIONAL'' in this document are to be interpreted as
described in \cite{RFC2119,RFC8174} when, and only when, they appear
in all capitals, as shown here.



The intermediate representation is specified in terms of serialised JSON
\cite{RFC7159} objects that describe the packet formats to be specified.
An interpreter for the intermediate representation will read a sequence of
such objects and perform the operations described, in the order that they
objects are read.

Each JSON object in the intermediate representation MUST contain a member
named \texttt{irobject} that describes the contents of the object.
Whether other members are included in the object depends on the value of
the \texttt{irobject} member.

%==================================================================================================
\section{Type System}

Types can be \emph{internal} or \emph{representable}. A representable type
describes something that can be parsed or serialised. An internal type is
an artefact of the runtime, and cannot be parsed or serialised.

Each type has \emph{name}. It implements one or more \emph{traits} that
define \emph{methods} that can operate on instances of that type. Some
types also have \emph{values} and \emph{attributes}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Primitive Types}
\label{sec:primitives}

The \code{Nothing} type is the empty type. It has no value and no attributes,
and implement no traits.

The \code{Boolean} type is a boolean value, either \code{true} or \code{false}.
It implements the traits \code{Value}, \code{Equality}, and \code{Boolean}.

The \code{Size} type is a positive integral value, denoting the size of an
instance of a representable type. It implements the traits \code{Value},
\code{Equality}, \code{Ordinal}, and \code{Arithmetic}.

The primitive types are built-in to the runtime, and are not explicitly
defined in the JSON form of the intermediate representation.

\subsubsection{Traits}
\label{sec:traits}

Traits define the methods that can operate on instances of types that
implement the trait.

A trait definition includes the name of the trait, and the definitions
of the methods. It defines a new type that has the specified name.

The name of a trait is formed of upper and lower case ASCII letters,
digits, or dollar signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}); it MUST begin with an
upper case letter (\code{A-Z}). Trait names are defined in the global type
namespace.  It is an error to define a trait that has the same name as an
existing type.

Each method definition include the method name, return type, parameters.
Methods take one or more parameters.
The first parameter of a method MUST have the name \code{self} and MUST
have an unspecified type.
Other parameters, if any, MUST have names that are unique within that
method definition, and can have specified or unspecified types.
The return type of a method can be specified or unspecified.  
It is an error to define two methods that have the same name.

Method names and parameter names are formed of upper and lower case ASCII
letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_});
they MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).

When a type implements a trait, any unspecified types are set to the
implementing type.

When a method is called on an instance of a type that implements a trait,
that instance will be passed as the first parameter of the method.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, a trait definition is
represented as in the following example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "trait"
    "name"        : "Eq",
    "methods"     : [
      {
        "name"       : "eq",
        "parameters" : [
          {
            "name"   : "self",
            "type"   : null
          },
          {
            "name"   : "other",
            "type"   : null,
          }
        ],
        "returnType" : "Boolean"
      },
      {
        "name"       : "ne",
        "parameters" : [
          {
            "name"   : "self",
            "type"   : null
          },
          {
            "name"   : "other",
            "type"   : null,
          }
        ],
        "returnType" : "Boolean"
      }
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


The runtime defines the following standard traits, where \verb|_| indicates
an unspecified type:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  trait Value {
    method get(self : _) -> _
    method set(self : _, value : _) -> Nothing
  }

  trait Equality {
    method eq(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
    method ne(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
  }

  trait Ordinal {
    // <, <=, >, >=
    method lt(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
    method le(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
    method gt(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
    method ge(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
  }

  trait Boolean {
    method and(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
    method  or(self : _, other : _) -> Boolean;
    method not(self : _) -> Boolean;
  }

  trait Arithmetic {
    method     plus(self : _, other : _) -> _;
    method    minus(self : _, other : _) -> _;
    method multiply(self : _, other : _) -> _;
    method   divide(self : _, other : _) -> _;
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Representable Types}
\label{sec:representable}


% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Bit Strings}
\label{sec:bit-string}

The base representable types are instances of \code{BitString}. They denote
a sequence of bits can be parsed or serialised. The \code{BitString} type
constructor has a single attribute, \code{width}, of type \code{Size}, that
indicates the number of bits in the \code{BitString}. The width MAY be
unspecified.

Instantiations of \code{BitString} types implement the \code{Value} and
\code{Equality} traits. The former allows the value of the \code{BitString}
instantiation to be retrieved and set. The latter allows two instantiations
of \code{BitString} to be compared for equality; they are equal if they
have the same name, value, and \code{width}.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, an instance of a
\code{BitString} type constructor is represented as in the following
example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "bitstring"
    "name"        : "SeqNum",
    "width"       : 16
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The \code{name} field specifies the name of the newly defined type. The
name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and dollar
signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Type names are defined in the global type namespace. 
It is an error to define the same type more than once.

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Arrays}

An array type represents a sequence of elements of some other type that can
be parsed or serialised. The array type constructor is parameterised by the 
name of the new array type, type of the elements it contains, and the length
of the new array. The length MAY be unspecified. 

An array has a single attribute, \code{length}, of type \code{Size}, that
denotes the number of elements contained. An array cannot contain elements
of its own type.

Arrays implement the \code{Equality} trait. Two arrays are equal if they
have the same element type, \code{length}, and their elements are equal.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, an instance of an
array type constructor is represented as in the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "array",
    "name"        : "SeqNum",
    "elementType" : "Bit"
    "length"      : 16
  }
\end{verbatim}
The \code{name} field specifies the name of the newly defined type. The
name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and dollar
signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Type names are defined in the global type namespace.
It is an error to define the same type more than once.

\todo{Arrays need to implement a trait that gives access to their elements}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Structure Types}

A structure type represents a sequence of fields, with possibly different
types, that can be parsed and serialised. A structure type constructor is
parameterised by the name of the structure, details of the fields, and any
constraints on the field values.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, the type constructor
for a structure type is represented as in the following example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "struct"
    "name"        : "<string>",
    "fields"      : [
      {
        "name"      : "...",
        "type"      : "...",
        "isPresent" : <boolean constraint>
      },
      ...
    ],
    "constraints" : [
      ...
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The \code{name} field specifies the name of the newly defined type. The
name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and dollar
signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Type names are defined in the global type namespace.
It is an error to define the same type more than once.

The \code{fields} define the attributes of the new structure type. Each
field has a name, a type, and a constraint that indicates if the field is
present in a particular instantiation of the structure type. Structure
types MUST contain at least one field.

Each field has a name that is formed of upper and lower case ASCII letters,
digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_}). The field name
MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).

Each field has a type. That type MUST have been previously defined, and can
be a \code{BitString}, array, structure type, or enumerated type. The names
of each field MUST be unique within a structure definition, but several
fields can have the same type.

Each field has a \emph{constraint}, \code{isPresent}, that indicates
whether that field is present in a particular instantiation of the
structure type. This is used to model data formats that contain optional
fields. Constraints are described in Section \ref{sec:constraints}.

Finally, a structure type is parameterised by a set of constraints on the
fields. The set of constraints MAY be empty. Constraints are described in
Section \ref{sec:constraints}.

\subsubsection{Enumerated Types}

An enumerated type represents data that can exist as one of several possible
variants when parsed or serialised. The type constructor is parameterised by
the name of the new enumerated type, and the types of the variants.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, the type constructor
for an enumerated type is represented as in the following example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "enum"
    "name"        : "<string>",
    "variants"    : [
      {"type" : "<typename>"},
      ...
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The \code{name} field specifies the name of the newly defined type. The
name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and dollar
signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Type names are defined in the global type namespace.
It is an error to define the same type more than once.

The \code{variants} field is an array that specifies the possible types
that variants of the enumerated type can take. These types MUST have been
previously defined, and the variants array MUST NOT be empty. Variants of
an enumerated type have their own types, but are otherwise unnamed.

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Derived Types}

A derived type constructor defines a new type as an extension of an existing
base type. A type derived in this way has the same representation and properties
as the type it is derived from, but has a new name and is distinct from the
original type. It can also implement additional traits.

The type constructor is parameterised by the name of the new derived type,
the base type from which it is derived, and a (possibly empty) list of any
additional traits the new type implements.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, a type constructor for
a derived type is represented as in the following example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "newtype",
    "name"        : "SpinBit",
    "derivedFrom" : "Bit",
    "alsoImplements" : [
      {"trait" : "TraitName"},
      {"trait" : "AdditionalTrait"}
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The \code{name} field specifies the name of the newly defined type. The
name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and dollar
signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Type names are defined in the global type namespace.

The \code{derivedFrom} field indicates the type from which the new type is
derived.  A new type can be derived from an existing \code{BitString},
array, structure type, or enumerated type. It is an error to define a new
type that has the same name as an existing type. A new type cannot be
derived from itself.

The \code{alsoImplements} field is an array that specifies any additional
traits that the new type implements compared to the base type. It is an
error to specify traits that are implemented by the base type.
The \code{alsoImplements} fields MAY be \code{null} to indicate that the
derived type does not implement any additional traits compared to the base
type.

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Functions}
\label{sec:functions}

A function definition specifies the type of a function defined in the
runtime. The code comprising the body of the function is not specified. 

A function has a name and a return type. It takes a number of parameters,
each of which has its own name and type. The return type \code{Nothing}
is used for functions that return no value.

Function names and parameter names are formed of upper and lower case ASCII
letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_}), and
MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).
Function names are defined in the global type namespace.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, a function definition
is represented as in the following example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "function"
    "name"        : "decrypt",
    "parameters"  : [
      {
        "name" : "enc_payload",
        "type" : "Cryptobits"
      },
      {
        "name" : "pn",
        "type" : "FullPacketNum"
      }
    ],
    "returnType"  : "Bit",
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Protocols}

A protocol type constructor describes the protocol data units (PDUs) that
can be parsed and serialised. The type constructor is parameterised by the
name of the protocol, a set of type definitions, and the set of PDUs used
in the protocol.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, a protocol definition
is represented as in the following example:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "irobject"    : "protocol",
    "name"        : "RTPv2",
    "definitions" : [
                      ...
                    ],
    "pdus"        : [
       {"type" : "RtpPacket"},
       {"type" : "RtcpPacket"}
    ]
  }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
A protocol is the top-level object in the JSON form of the intermediate
representation.

The \code{name} field specifies the name of the newly defined type. The
name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and dollar
signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Type names are defined in the global type namespace.

The \code{definitions} field that contains an array of objects representing
the types and functions used by the protocol. Any representable type, as
defined in Section \ref{sec:representable}, can be included.

The \code{pdus} field contains an array giving the type of the PDUs used
in the protocol. A protocol MUST define at least one PDU. PDUs can be any
structure type or enumerated type.

Where \texttt{constraint} has the value \texttt{constant}, the JSON object MUST have the
following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "constraint"    : "constant",
    "value"         : "<integer>"
  }
\end{verbatim}

All members MUST be set.

\subsubsection{\texttt{field\_name}}

Where \texttt{constraint} has the value \texttt{field\_name}, the JSON object must have
the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
  {
    "constraint" : "field_name",
    "value"      : "<string>",
    "property"   : "<'value'
                    |'length'
                    |'is_present'>"
  }
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{value} MUST correspond to a field name defined within the \texttt{fields} JSON
array of the enclosing structure object. \texttt{property} refers to one of the three
inherent properties of fields: their value, length, or presence in the parsed structure.

    "left"       : "<constraint>",
    "right"	     : "<constraint"
  }
\end{verbatim}

Both \texttt{left} and \texttt{right} MUST be set to constraint objects.

    "value"      : "?:",
    "cond"       : "<constraint>",
    "true"       : "<constraint>",
    "else"       : "<constraint>"
  }
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{cond}, \texttt{true}, and \texttt{else} MUST be set to constraint objects.
