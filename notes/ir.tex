  implementation of the Glasgow Packet Language. It also describes
  the execution model used to parse protocols described in that
  language.

\section{Introduction}

% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?



% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.

In order to generate a parser for a protocol, it's necessary to describe
the format of protocol data units (PDUs).
These can be described by a set of types that represent the objects to be
parsed, along with constraints on the parsed values.
If there are multiple ways of describing these types, it's necessary to
have a common \emph{intermediate representation} into which all those input
formats can be converted, and from which parsers can be generated.

% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs 
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

We describe such an intermediate representation in this memo.
It specifies a set of internal types used by the parsers, and constructors
for representable types that describe the PDUs to be parsed.
The execution model of the parsers is also described.

% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.



% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

\section{Terminology}

The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'', ``NOT RECOMMENDED'',
``MAY'', and ``OPTIONAL'' in this document are to be interpreted as
described in \cite{RFC2119,RFC8174} when, and only when, they appear
in all capitals, as shown here.

%==================================================================================================
\section{Type System}

Types can be \emph{internal} or \emph{representable}. A representable type
describes something that can be parsed or serialised. An internal type is
an artefact of the runtime, and cannot be parsed or serialised.

Representable types MUST implement the \code{Sized} trait.

Each type has a \emph{kind} and a \emph{name}. It implements one or more
\emph{traits} that define \emph{methods} that can operate on instances of
that type.

A type name is formed of upper- and lower-case ASCII letters, digits, and
dollar signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}). It must begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). It is an error to define two types with the same name.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Internal Types}

There are four internal types: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \code{Nothing} type is the empty type. 
    It implements no traits and has no methods.

  \item The \code{Boolean} type is a boolean value, either \code{true} or
    \code{false}.  It implements the traits \code{Value}, \code{Equality}
    (two \code{Boolean}s are equal if they have the same value), and
    \code{BooleanOps}.

  \item The \code{Integer} type is an integral value. It implements the
    traits \code{Value}, \code{Equality}, \code{Ordinal}, and
    \code{ArithmeticOps}.

  \item The \code{Size} type is a subtype of the \code{Integer} type, for
    positive integral values denoting the size of an instance of a
    representable type. It implements no additional traits beyond those
    of its \code{Integer} parent type.
\end{itemize}

The primitive types are built-in to the runtime and do not need to be
explicitly instantiated.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Traits}
\label{sec:traits}

A \emph{trait} defines a named collection of methods. A type may implement
one or more traits. A type that implements a trait gains an implementation
of each of the trait's methods.

A trait definition specifies the name of the trait and defines the methods
it provides.

A trait name is comprised of upper and lower case ASCII letters, digits, or
dollar signs (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$}).  It MUST begin with an upper case letter
(\code{A-Z}). Trait names occupy a different namespace to type names.

A method definition specifies its name, parameters, and return type.
Methods take one or more parameters.
Each parameter has a name and a type.
The first parameter of a method must have the name \code{self} and must
have an unspecified type.
Other parameters, if any, must have names that are unique within the method
definition, and can have either specified or unspecified types.
The return type of a method can be specified or unspecified.

Method names and parameter names are formed of upper and lower case ASCII
letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_}). They
MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).
It is an error to define two methods that have the same name within a given
trait.

When a type implements a trait that includes methods with unspecified
types, the corresponding types are set to the implementing type. That is,
unspecified types are reified when a trait it implemented by a type.

When a method is called on an instance of a type that implements a trait,
that instance will be passed as the first parameter of the method.

The runtime defines the following traits:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \code{Value} trait defines the following two methods that can
    be used to get and set the value of an instance of a type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{get(self: \_) -> \_}
      \item \texttt{set(self: \_, value: \_) -> Nothing}
    \end{itemize}
    The syntax \emph{name(parameters) -> return\_type} is used to
    describe a method. The parameters are a  list of \emph{name: type}
    pairs. A type of \texttt{\_} is unspecified.

  \item The \code{Sized} trait defines a method that can be used to get the
    size, in bits, of an instance of a type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{size(self: \_) -> Size}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \code{IndexCollection} trait defines methods that can be used
    to get and set the values of elements of an array-like data structure,
    which has multiple, numerically indexed elements:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{get(self: \_, index: Size) -> \_}
      \item \texttt{set(self, \_, index: Size, value: \_) -> Nothing}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \code{Equality} trait defines methods that can be used to
    compare to instances of a type for equality:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{eq(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
      \item \texttt{ne(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \code{Ordinal} trait defines methods that can be used to
    compare the values of instances of a type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{lt(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
      \item \texttt{le(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
      \item \texttt{gt(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
      \item \texttt{ge(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \code{BooleanOps} trait defines methods that can be used to
    perform boolean operations on, and between, instances of a type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{and(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
      \item \texttt{ or(self: \_, other: \_) -> Boolean}
      \item \texttt{not(self: \_) -> Boolean}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \code{ArithmeticOps} trait defines methods that can be used to
    perform arithmetic operations on instances of a type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{plus(self: \_, other: \_) -> \_}
      \item \texttt{minus(self: \_, other: \_) -> \_}
      \item \texttt{multiply(self: \_, other: \_) -> \_}
      \item \texttt{divide(self: \_, other: \_) -> \_}
      \item \texttt{modulo(self: \_, other: \_) -> \_}
    \end{itemize}

  \item The \code{IntegerRepresentable} trait defines a method that can be
    used to represent a type as an \code{Integer} type:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{to\_integer(self: \_) -> Integer}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Representable Types}
\label{sec:representable}

The runtime does not define any representable types. Rather, it defines
a number of \emph{type constructors} that allow appropriate types to be
created as needed to represent a protocol.

\subsubsection{Bit Strings}
\label{sec:bit-string}

Representable types of kind \code{BitString} can be constructed to
represent multi-bit values that can be parsed or serialised.

The \code{BitString} type constructor takes as parameters the \emph{name}
of the new bit string type and a \emph{size} in bits. The size may be
unspecified. 

Instances of \code{BitString} types implement the \code{Sized}, \code{Value},
\code{Equality}, and \code{IntegerRepresentable} traits. 

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Arrays}

Representable types of kind \code{Array} can be constructed to represent
a sequence of elements that can be parsed or serialised.

The \code{Array} type constructor takes as parameters the \emph{name} of
the new array type, the \emph{element type}, and the \emph{length} of the
new array.
The element type must be a previously defined representable type.
The length is the number of elements contained in the array.
The length may be unspecified. 

Instances of \code{Array} types implement the \code{Equality}, \code{Sized},
and \code{IndexCollection} traits.
Two arrays are equal if they have the same element type and length, and
their elements are equal.
The size of the array is equal to the length of the array multiplied by the
size of element type.

\subsubsection{Structure Types}

Representable types of kind \code{Struct} can be constructed to represent
a sequence of fields, with possibly different types, that can be parsed
and serialised.

The \code{Struct} type constructor takes as parameters the \emph{name} of
the new structure type, a list of \emph{fields}, a possibly empty list of
\emph{constraints} on those fields, and a possibly empty list of
\emph{actions} that are to be carried out once the structure has been
parsed.

\emph{Fields} are constructed with a \emph{name} for the field, the
\emph{type} of the field, an expression indicating if the field
\emph{is present} in a particular instantiation of the structure type,
and, optionally, an expression for how the field
should be transformed after the structure has been parsed. Structure types
MUST contain at least one field.

Field names are formed of upper and lower case ASCII letters,
digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_}). The field name
MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).

Field types MUST have been previously defined.
Fields can be of \code{BitString}, array, structure type, or enumerated type,
or a subtype of such a type. The names of each field MUST be unique
within a structure definition, but several fields can have the same type.

Each field has an \emph{is present} expression that indicates
whether that field is present in a particular instantiation of the
structure type. This is used to model data formats that contain optional
fields. Expressions are described in Section \ref{sec:expressions}. The
\emph{is present} expression MUST evaluate to a \code{Boolean} value.

Each field has a \emph{transform} expression.
The \code{transform} expression MAY be \code{null}, indicating that no
transformation is performed. Alternatively, it is constructed with 
the \emph{name} and \emph{Type} that the field is transformed into,
alongside the \emph{function name} of the function that should be
used to perform the transformation.
If the transform expression is specified, it indicates that the original
field is parsed, then the transformation function is invoked, then the field
is replaced by a new field with the name and type specified in the transform
expression.
The transform function MUST take a single argument of the same type as
the original field, and the return type of the function MUST
match the type specified by the transform expression.
The type that the field is transformed into MUST have the same size as the original
type of the field.

A structure type implements the \code{Sized} trait. The size of a structure is the
sum of the sizes of its fields.

A structure type also implements the \code{Equality} trait. Two structures
are equal if they contain the same fields, in the same order, and the
corresponding fields are equal. Two fields are equal if they have the same
\emph{name}, the same \emph{type}, the same \emph{is present} expression
that evaluates to the same value, and the same \emph{transform} expression.

A structure type is parameterised by a set of constraints (i.e., boolean
expressions that MUST evaluate to \code{True}) on the
fields. The set of constraints MAY be empty. Expressions are described in
Section \ref{sec:expressions}.

Finally, on the successful parsing of the structure type, the list of
\emph{actions} are evaluated. The list of actions MAY be empty. The
expressions in the list of actions MUST be \code{Update} tree expressions,
and each expression MUST return \code{Nothing}. Actions are typically
expected to update the parsing context (see Section \ref{sec:context}).

\subsubsection{Enumerated Types}

Representable types of kind \code{Enum} can be constructed to represent
data that can exist as one of several possible variants when parsed or
serialised.

The \code{Enum} type constructor takes as parameters the \emph{name} of the
new \code{Enum} type and the types of the \emph{variants} that the
\code{Enum} might take.

Variant types MUST have been
previously defined, and the variants list MUST NOT be empty. Variants of
an enumerated type have their own types, but are otherwise unnamed.
Variants can be of \code{BitString}, array, structure type, or enumerated type, or
a subtype of such a type.

An enumerated type implements the \code{Sized} trait. The size of an enumerated type
is equal to the size of the instantiated variant. Variants are not
necessarily all the same size.

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Subtypes}

Subtyping allows for the creation of types as substitutable extensions of
existing types. A subtype has the same representation
and properties as its parent supertype, but has a new name and is
distinct from the original type. It MAY also implement additional traits.

The type constructor is parameterised by the name of the new subtype,
the type that it subtypes, and a (possibly empty) list of traits the new
type implements.

A new type can subtype an existing \code{BitString},
array, structure type, or enumerated type. It is an error to define a new
type that has the same name as an existing type. A new type cannot subtype
itself.

Subtypes do not inherit the traits and methods of their supertype. However,
when a method is invoked that the subtype does not implement, the subtype is
recursively converted to the first supertype that \emph{does} implement the 
method. This allows subtypes to override methods implemented by their
supertypes.

Finally, subtypes can substitute for their supertypes as an argument to a
method, where the parameter type is the supertype.

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Functions}
\label{sec:functions}

Representable types of kind \code{Function} can be constructed to represent
the signature of a function to be provided by the implementation of
the protocol. The code comprising the body of the function is not captured. 

The \code{Function} type constructor is parameterised by the \emph{name} of
the function, the list of \emph{parameters} that the function takes (each
with its own name and type), and the function's \emph{return type}.
The return type \code{Nothing} is used for functions that return no value.

Function names and parameter names are formed of upper and lower case ASCII
letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_}), and
MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).
Function names are defined in the global type namespace.
Each parameter within a function definition MUST have a unique name.

A function type implements the \code{Sized} trait. The size of the function is that of
its return type.

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Protocols}

Representable types of kind \code{Protocol} can be constructed to represent
the types and protocol data units (PDUs) that form a protocol.

The \code{Protocol} type constructor is parameterised by the \emph{name} of the
protocol, a set of \emph{type definitions}, and the list of names of \emph{PDUs} used in
the protocol.

Any representable type, as defined in Section \ref{sec:representable}, can
be included in the list of type definitions.

The list of PDU names MAY be empty, although this represents a
protocol that is useless. PDU names can be type names of any structure type
or enumerated type. 

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Parsing Context}
\label{sec:context}

The \code{Context} type constructor allows creation of a type that
represents a sequence of fields, possibly of different types, that can be
accessed in the parsing of other types, where needed. The context type
constructor is parameterised by the details of the fields it includes.

The \code{Context} holds internal state for the parser, and does not
represent a PDU, or any part of a PDU, of the protocol being parsed.
The \code{Context} is defined along with the other \code{definitions}
in a \code{Protocol}, however, since it is specific to a protocol.

In the JSON form of the intermediate representation, invocation of the type
constructor for a context type is represented as in the following:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "construct"   : "Context"
    "fields"      : [
      \{
        "name"    : "\emph{field name}",
        "type"    : "\emph{field type}"
      \},
      ...
    ]
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
At most one context can be instantiated.

Each field has a name that is formed of upper and lower case ASCII letters,
digits, dollar signs, or underscores (\code{A-Za-z0-9\$\_}). The field name
MUST begin with a lower case letter (\code{a-z}).

Each field has a type. That type MUST have been previously defined, and can
be a \code{BitString}, array, structure type, or enumerated type. The names
of each field MUST be unique within a structure definition, but several
fields can have the same type.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Expressions}
\label{sec:expressions}

Expressions are split into two classes: 
tree (\code{MethodInvocation}, \code{FunctionInvocation}, \code{FieldAccess}, 
      \code{ContextAccess}, and \code{IfElse})
and 
leaf (\code{This}, and \code{Constant}).

Expressions can be resolved to a type using their \code{get\_result\_type} method:

\code{get\_result\_type(self: Expression, containing\_type: ProtocolType) -> ProtocolType}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{Tree Expressions}

A \code{MethodInvocation} tree expression is represented in the JSON form of the
intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"   : "MethodInvocation",
    "target"       : \emph{expression},
    "method"       : "\emph{method name}",
    "arguments"    : [
      \{
        "name"  : "\emph{parameter name}",
        "value" : \emph{expression}
      \},
      ...
    ]
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
The \code{MethodInvocation} expression evaluates to the result of applying \code{method}
to \code{target}, with the arguments specified in \code{arguments}. The \code{target} is
either a \code{This} or \code{Context} leaf expression, or a tree expression.

A \code{FunctionInvocation} tree expression is represented in the JSON form of the
intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"   : "FunctionInvocation",
    "name"         : \emph{function name},
    "arguments"    : [
      \{
        "name"  : "\emph{parameter name}",
        "value" : \emph{expression}
      \},
      ...
    ]
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
The \code{name} MUST refer to a previously defined \code{Function}. The set
of \code{arguments} MUST contain values for all of the parameters specified
in the \code{Function} definition, and the \code{value} expression for each
MUST evaluate to a value matching the type of the parameter as specified in
the \code{Function} definition. The \code{FunctionInvocation} expression
itself evaluates to the \code{return\_type} specified in the
\code{Function} definition.

A \code{FieldAccess} tree expression is represented in the JSON form of the
intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"  : "FieldAccess",
    "target"      : \emph{expression},
    "field"       : \emph{field name},
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
When the target is a structure type, returns a reference to the specified
field of the structure.
It is an error to invoke \code{FieldAccess} on a target that is not a
structure type.

A \code{ContextAccess} tree expression is represented in the JSON form
of the intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"  : "ContextAccess",
    "field"       : \emph{field name}
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
A \code{ContextAccess} expression returns a reference to the specified
field in the parsing context.

A \code{IfElse} tree expression is represented in the JSON form of the
intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"  : "IfElse",
    "condition"   : \emph{expression},
    "if\_true"     : \emph{expression},
    "if\_false"    : \emph{expression}
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
The \code{IfElse} includes a \code{condition} that evaluates to the \code{Boolean} type.
The \code{IfElse} expression evaluates to the \code{if\_true} member, if \code{condition}
is \code{True}. Otherwise, the expression evaluates to the \code{if\_false} member.

\subsubsection{Leaf Expressions}

A \code{This} leaf expression is represented in the JSON form of the
intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"   : "This"
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
It evaluates to a reference to the current object (i.e., the object to
which the expression is attached).

A \code{Constant} leaf expression is represented in the JSON form of the
intermediate representation as:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
    "expression"   : "Constant",
    "type"         : "\emph{type name}",
    "value"        : \emph{value}
  \}
\end{alltt}
\normalsize
The \code{Constant} expression evaluates to the specified \code{value},
which has type specified by the \code{type} field.

\subsubsection{Example}

An expression comparing to the \code{version} field of the current
structure object to the constant value 2 would be written:
\footnotesize
\begin{alltt}
  \{
     "expression" : "MethodInvocation",
     "target"     : \{
       "expression" : "FieldAccess",
       "target" : \{
         "expression" : "This"
       \},
       "field"    : "version"
     \},
     "method"     : "eq",
     "arguments"  : [
       \{
         "name"  : "other",
         "value" : \{
           "expression" : "Constant",
           "type"       : "Int16",
           "value"      : "2"
         \}
       \}
     ]
  \}
\end{alltt}
