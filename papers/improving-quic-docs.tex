% The hyperref package is problematic. Known issues include:

%      "pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier 
%      (name{page.}) has been already used, duplicate ignored".
%    since hyperref tries to refer to the page number.
%  - The algorithmic package uses the same line-numbering scheme for each
%    algorithm, and can cause duplicate identifier warnings if you have
%    several algorithms with line numbers (this may have been fixed with 
%    recent versions of algorithmic...).
%  - If using the algorithm package with hyperref, you need to load packages
%    in the following order (see README in hyperref documentation):
%      \usepackage{float}
%      \usepackage{hyperref}
%      \usepackage{algorithm}
% For these reasons, hyperref is best to avoid for most papers, however if
% needed, uncomment the following two lines:
%  \usepackage{float}
%  \usepackage{hyperref}

% The algorithm package defines the algorithm environment. This is used in
% the same way as the figure and table environments, to include algorithms
% in a paper. The algpseudocode package provides the ability to typeset the

\section{Introduction}

% A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set
% of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can
% be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you
% can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all
% cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and
% in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.
%
% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?

ASCII packet header diagrams are the most common formalism found in IETF standards
documents. These diagrams allow for the visualisation packet formats, reducing human error
by aiding in the implementation of protocol parsers. However, while ASCII diagrams can
capture much of the syntax of existing protocols, like TCP and UDP, the complexity
introduced by newer protocols, such as QUIC \cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport-latest},
diminishes their utility. As a result, correct parser implementations are much more
reliant upon the careful interpretation of prose descriptions of the protocol's syntax.
This is a situation that is likely to result in buggy and non-conformant implementations.

% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.

While there have been many previous efforts to develop formalisms that better capture the
syntax of protocols, these are largely unsuitable for QUIC. QUIC includes protected
packets, requiring decryption using data from packets earlier in the flow. Prior work,
which has focussed on the parsing of individual, unencrypted packets, is unable to model
this. As a result, QUIC, and the broader shift to pervasive encryption \cite{rfc7258},
require a new formalism.

% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs 
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

In this paper, we describe SYSTEMNAME, a framework for formalising the description of
packet layers. SYSNAME is comprised of three components: an input parser, an intermediary
representation, and an output formatter. This architecture allows packets to be described
using a number of different languages, and for such descriptions to be parsed into a
common intermediate form. Output formatters can then use this intermediate representation
to generate various artefacts, such as a parser. We provide an example of how this
framework can be used to capture the complexity of QUIC, and automatically generate parser
code.

% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.

There have been many previous attempts at defining a packet format definition language,
including PacketTypes \cite{mccann2000packet}, Melange \cite{madhavapeddy2007melange},
PADS \cite{fisher2005pads}, and DataScript \cite{back2002datascript}. While these
languages differ, both in their syntax and the protocol features they can model, all are
designed for parsing individual, unencrypted packets. SYSTEMNAME supports QUIC, and other
protocols, by including \emph{contexts} and \emph{prototypes}, to support the flow-based
parsing of encrypted packets.

% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

We structure the remainder of this paper as follows. Section \ref{sec:motivation} expands
on our motivation, by assessing the utility provided by an ASCII diagram from the QUIC
standards documents. Section \ref{sec:SYSTEMNAME} describes SYSTEMNAME, our proposed
framework for describing packet formats. Section \ref{sec:casestudy} provides an example
of how SYSTEMNAME can be used to better capture the syntax of QUIC's short header packets.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:related} discusses related work, and Section
\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

%==================================================================================================
% Concentrate single-mindedly on a narrative that:
%  - Describes the problem, and why it's interesting
%  - Describes your idea
%  - Defends your idea, showing how it solves the problem, and filling out
%    the details
% On the way, cite relevant work in passing, but defer discussion to the
% end.
%
% Introduce the problem, and your idea, using examples, and only then
% present the general case. Explain the idea as if your were speaking to
% someone using a whiteboard. Conveying the intuition is primary; details
% follow. Write in a top down manner: state broad themes and ideas first,
% then go into details.
%
% The introduction makes claims. The body of the paper provides evidence
% to support each claim. Check each claim in the introduction, identify
% the evidence, and forward-reference it from the claim.

\label{sec:casestudy}

% The details

% Describe results carefully:
%  - clearly state assumptions
%  - give enough information to allow the reader to recreate the results
%  - ensure results are representative; statistically meaningful, etc.
%  - don't overstate results
%  - equally, don't understate them: consider the broader implications

%==================================================================================================
\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

% This should come near the end, and focussing on discussing how your work
% relates to that of others. Any relevant related work should have been
% cited already, so this is not a list of related work, it's a discussion
% of how that work relates.
%
% Why not put related work after the introduction? 1) because describing
% alternative approaches gets between the reader and your idea; and 2)
% because the reader knows nothing about the problem yet, so your
% (carefully trimmed) description of various technical trade-offs is
% absolutely incomprehensible.
% 
% When writing the related work:
%  - Give credit to others where it's due; this doesn't diminish the
%    credit you get from your paper. 
%  - Acknowledge weaknesses in your approach.
%  - Ensure related work is accurate and up-to-date
